# Todo App

A todo list allows you to prioritize the tasks that are more important. This means you don't waste time on tasks that don't require your immediate attention. Your list will help you stay focused on the tasks that are the most important. I have made my app with various functionalities. we can keep a deadline to a Todo and can change the deadline if one wishes. A deleted todo will be remained in Trash page from where we can restore or delete a Todo permanently
